# üìñ‚òïe-Reader-auto-daily-news‚òïüìñ
A small project to automate how you can retrieve free and legal daily news fresh-off-the-press to read every morning on your e-reader while you drink your coffee.

This project automates the process of fetching news articles from various sources and syncing them to Dropbox, specifically for use with a **Kobo** eReader. 

## Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi (or similar Linux-based device) with Desktop environment (CLI requires Cron automation, which can be done but I just used the GUI... reason why below)
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
- [Maestral](https://maestral.app/) (for Dropbox syncing)
- Dropbox account
- Internet connection
- eReader **‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The following steps may void your eReader's warranty. Proceed at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any issues that may arise.**
- Dropbox compatibility (special set-up for kobo clara)

  ## The Applications Used:
- **Calibre** is a great free application for e-book file conversion, metadata editing, news fetching, and much more. It is a must for all eReader owners.
- **Maestral** is a lightweight Dropbox client that is easy to set up and run.
- **KoReader** is a document reader and **NickelMenu** is a customizable menu system that allows you to access apps you add to your eReader like KoReader.
  You do not need to Root your device to install these, at least on Kobo. Kobo allows running 3rd-party software from the .adds folder on the device.

  ## General Understanding:
- This guide shows how to set your Raspberry Pi up as a server that fetches news articles, downloads it to a folder, and automatically syncs them with the Dropbox 
  cloud. You are then able to download your articles and other Dropbox media on your eReader if you have an internet connection.

## Gaining Dropbox Compatibility (**Kobo**)
Some eReaders do not come with out-of-the box Dropbox compatibility. This can be achieved using **KoReader** and **NickelMenu**:
1. Follow this tutorial to download **KoReader** and **NickelMenu**: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ9AIJW-qGI'
2. With your eReader plugged in, navigate to 'KOBOeReader/.adds/nm/config.'
3. add 'menu_item:main:dropbox:nickel_open:library:dropbox'. It doesn't matter where, you can just add it to the very top of the file.
4. With your eReader plugged in, navigate to 'Kobo(E:)/.kobo/Kobo/KoboReader.conf'.
5. Find: 'dropbox_link_account_poll=' and change to 'dropbox_link_account_poll= https://authorize.kobo.com/{region}/{language}/LinkDropbox', change your region and language to what you want.
6. Find: 'kobo_dropbox_link_account_enabled=False' and change to 'kobo_dropbox_link_account_enabled=True'.
7. Restart your eReader.
8. Press on your NickelMenu, press Dropbox, and follow the steps to connect.

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Install Calibre**  
   Instructions for installing Calibre (you can follow their [installation guide](https://calibre-ebook.com/download)).

2. **Install Maestral**  
   Follow Maestral‚Äôs installation guide to sync your Dropbox on the Raspberry Pi.

3. **Setup Fetch News in Calibre**  
   - Open Calibre and go to **Fetch News** ‚Üí **Schedule News Download**.
   - Add your news sources (e.g., National Geographic, Bloomberg, etc.).
   - You can choose when to automatically delete news as well within the fetch news tab.
   - Set the output directory to `~/Dropbox/Apps/'Rakuten Kobo'/News/` by clicking on the down arrow to the right of the stack of books icon on the top menu, and
     switch/create library and change your library location.
   - Note the GUI must be running in order for the news syncing to work. Otherwise, you must set up cron jobs.

**Usage**
   - In your eReader, go to Dropbox (Via NickelMenu, if required for your device).
   - Navigate to your /News folder.
   - Download wanted articles
   - Happy reading!
